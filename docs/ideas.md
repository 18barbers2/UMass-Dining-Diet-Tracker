## Innovative Idea

Our project idea was to create a macro tracking application. Tracking macros is useful for people who are trying to lose/gain weight as well as just maintaining a balanced diet. Like many other macro tracking apps, we plan on allowing the user to track various nutrition information such as calories, fats, carbohydrates, protein, etc. However, our app will use the UMass dining database. Thus, users will be able to search for the food/drinks they had at one of the dining halls on campus and be able to see the nutritional information of their meal. Finally, we will allow users to create a profile and be able to monitor their macro intact over time.

## Important Components
We plan for our project to have a number of important components to offer a complete experience for our macro tracking application. One component we’re going to implement is a search feature that allows users to look up the food they ate based on certain criteria, like which dining hall and the time of day they ate. Another function we will implement is a summary of nutrient value based on what the person has eaten during a meal or over the course of a day. This part will be based upon input by the user. Our app will display this information using raw values as well as some infographics. Additionally, UMass provides a healthiness scale for each of their foods, so we will include a healthiness scale based on the aggregate of what someone has eaten. In order to acquire the data needed, we will interact with the UMass dining database via their API. Our app will interact with the UMass dining database and other features they provide, such as dietary restrictions like gluten-free and vegan food.
